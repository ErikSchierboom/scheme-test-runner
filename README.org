* Scheme Test Runner

 Dockerized tests on scheme exercisms.

** Misc Notes

  This is a setup script to check solutions to scheme exercisms in
  Docker. The script gets three parameters:

  - slug (eg. ~two-fer~)
  - path to solution directory (including final slash)
  - path to output directory

  The output is to be jsonized, in a file ~results.json~. Must exit
  with code 0 on success.

*** Output structure

  Fields are "status", "message"?, and "tests". Recursively, each test
  has "name", "status", "message"?, "output" as fields.

**** Status
  
  Possible values for status include "pass", "fail", "error". "error"
  is for unexpected exceptions.

*** Other reqs:

  Output must be limited to 500 chars!
