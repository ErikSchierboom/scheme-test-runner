* Scheme Test Runner

 Test scheme exercisms in docker.

** Notes

  The script gets three parameters:

  - slug (eg. ~two-fer~)
  - path to solution directory (including final slash)
  - path to output directory

  The output is to be in json in the file ~results.json~.

*** Output structure

  Fields are "status", "message"?, and "tests". Each test has "name",
  "status", "message"?, "output" as fields.

  Possible values for status include "pass", "fail", "error". "error"
  is for unexpected exceptions.

  All that should be implemented. Still need to ensure output is
  ~<500~ chars.
